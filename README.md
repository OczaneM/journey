# Stellar Journey
Stellar Journey is a 2D game that started as a stackathon project and was created with Phaser.io, ES6, and Webpack. Through the use of Phaser Arcade Physics and a drag and drop mechanic implementation, players are able to move Stella, the game's main character, through a field of asteroids from one map to the next.

# Setup
You'll need to install a few things before you have a working copy of the project.

## 1. Clone this repo:

Navigate into your workspace directory.

Run:

```git clone https://github.com/OczaneM/journey.git```

## 2. Install node.js and npm:

https://nodejs.org/en/


## 3. Install dependencies (optionally you can install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)):

Navigate to the cloned repo's directory.

Run:

```npm install```

or if you chose yarn, just run ```yarn```

## 4. Run the development server:

Run:

```npm run dev```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser. It will also start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser automatically.

To run the game, open your browser and enter http://localhost:3000 into the address bar.
